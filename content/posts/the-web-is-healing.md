## Part 1: The Web Is Broken

I know this is _**SHOCKING**_, but the web is broken. JS Where it has no
buisness being. It was so stupid.

### Case Study: Gatsby

Gatsby, for those unaware, was the epitome of stupidity. A **React**-powered
_Static Site Generator_.
YES, React, which should only exist for interactive websites,
in a static website generator.
And it was marketed as "Fast." I'm not sure how that works.
Slick, sure, but also slow to load.
People don't care about your animations
if it takes 8 seconds to load all
600 MB of JS Gatsby put in there.

## Part 2: The Web Is Healing

The internet has less JS Now!

## Case studies: Astro and Hugo

These are website generators.
Hugo is static.
Astro is more enterprise.
But both use AS LITTLE JS AS POSSIBLE! YAY!
Now your stupid website loads fast enough that I don't have to touch grass.
This website is tiny. Look at it. Built in Hugo.

## Conclusion

I think the web is healing, but think your own thoughts.
Anyway, I like yapping. That's all from Raj Hardy.
